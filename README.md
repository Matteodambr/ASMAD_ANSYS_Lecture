# ASMAD STRUCTURES TUTORIALS

This repository contains the materials used during the ASMAD STR seminar, that is contained in the slides. The results are not saved to limit the size of the repository, but can be generated with Ansys 2024 R1 (or later, Ansys models are forward-compatible); the models are very lightweight such that they can be run on any machine, and should only be used as representative examples and as quick references when developing your more complex models for the ASMAD project. If additional help or information is required, or you find an error in the examples, contact (2024/2025; matteo.dambrosio@polimi.it).

Available models:
1. Cantilever beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
2. Fixed-Fixed beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
3. Simplified spacecraft (BC examples, point- and distributed-mass, remote points, relevant structural analyses - modal - quasi-static - sine - random vibration - shock, retrieval of stress/deformations)
