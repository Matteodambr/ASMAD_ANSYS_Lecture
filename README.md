# ASMAD_ANSYS_Lecture

Repository with all materials for ASMAD STR seminar.

Note:
- All models are saved without results to limit size of repository.
- All models seen on the ASMAD STR slides can be found in this repository. The results have been produced with Ansys 2024 R1 Student Version, but newer versions of the software should have no problems opening the older models (Ansys is forward-compatible).

Available models:
1. Cantilever beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
2. Fixed-Fixed beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
3. Simplified spacecraft (BC examples, point- and distributed-mass, remote points, relevant structural analyses - modal - quasi-static - sine - random vibration - shock, retrieval of stress/deformations)
