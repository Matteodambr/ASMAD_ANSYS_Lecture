# ASMAD STRUCTURES TUTORIALS

This repository contains all materials used during the ASMAD STR seminar. The results are not saved to limit the size of the repository, but can be generated with Ansys 2024 R1 (or later, Ansys models are forward-compatible).
Note that the provided examples are non-exhaustive, and are only though to serve as quick references when developing more complex models for the ASMAD projects. For additional help or information, contact (2024/2025; matteo.dambrosio@polimi.it or lucia.bianchi@polimi.it).

Available models:
1. Cantilever beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
2. Fixed-Fixed beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
3. Simplified spacecraft (BC examples, point- and distributed-mass, remote points, relevant structural analyses - modal - quasi-static - sine - random vibration - shock, retrieval of stress/deformations)
