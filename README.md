# ASMAD STRUCTURES SEMINAR

This repository contains all sharable material used in class during the ASMAD STR seminar. The results have not been saved to limit the size of the repository, but can be generated with Ansys 2024 R1 (or later, Ansys models are forward-compatible). The models are lightweight such that they can be run regardless of your machine, and should only be used as representative examples and as quick references when developing your more complex models for the ASMAD project.

## Available models:
1. TODO: Cantilever beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
2. TODO: Fixed-Fixed beam (+ comparison w/ analytical solution)
3. TODO: Simplified spacecraft (BC examples, point- and distributed-mass, remote points, relevant structural analyses - modal - quasi-static - sine - random vibration - shock, retrieval of stress/deformations)

## Useful spacecraft structures references
These references can be found in the folder "References" in the ASMAD_Ansys_Tutorials repository.
